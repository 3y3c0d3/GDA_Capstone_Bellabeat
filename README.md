## Project Overview
This repository contains my capstone project for the Bellabeat Data Analysis case study. The goal of this project is to analyze fitness and health data collected by Bellabeat devices to derive insights that could help improve user experience, engagement, and product offerings. The project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and statistical techniques to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project consists of health and fitness data collected from users of Bellabeat devices. The data includes the following variables:

**Activity data:** step count, calories burned, active minutes, etc.

**Sleep data:** hours of sleep, sleep stages, etc.

**Health data:** heart rate, stress levels, etc.

**User demographics:** age, gender, height, weight, etc.

The data has been cleaned, processed, and transformed for analysis. Each file and its contents are described in detail below.

dailyActivity.csv: Contains activity metrics (steps, calories, etc.) by user.

sleepDay.csv: Contains sleep quality and duration data.

heart_rate.csv: Contains heart rate metrics

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in this project:

Python: Main programming language for data analysis and visualization.

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebooks: For data exploration and presentation.

GitHub: Version control and collaboration.

## Analysis
**Data Cleaning**
This data was cleaned and processed using Google Sheets, R, Python, BigQuery, and Tableau.

Before diving into the analysis, the data was cleaned and pre-processed to handle missing values and inconsistencies. Key steps included:

Dropping or imputing missing values (e.g., replacing missing sleep data with the mean value).

Filtering out irrelevant or duplicated entries.

Normalizing activity data to account for different time zones and units

**Key visualizations** (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices).

**Key Findings**
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I uncovered the following insights:

Active Users Sleep Better: The data shows a strong correlation between high step counts (10,000+ steps per day) and better sleep quality. This could suggest that users who maintain high activity levels may experience more restful sleep.

Stress Reduces Engagement: Users who report high stress levels seem to have lower engagement with the device, which may suggest that Bellabeat could offer stress management features to improve user retention and engagement.

Activity is Higher on Weekdays: A clear trend was found where users tend to be more active on weekdays, likely due to the structure of the workweek. This could inform marketing strategies that target weekday behavior.

These insights can inform potential product improvements and user engagement strategies for Bellabeat

## Recommendations
Based on these insights, the following recommendations were made:

Feature Improvements: Introduce features to help users track and manage stress, which could potentially increase engagement.

Engagement Strategies: Develop strategies to encourage weekend activity and maintain user engagement, possibly through challenges or rewards.

Personalization: Suggest personalized recommendations for users based on their activity and sleep patterns (e.g., providing tailored sleep tips for high-activity users)

Conclusion
This project analyzed fitness and health data from Bellabeat’s devices and uncovered valuable insights about user behavior. By focusing on activity, sleep, and stress, I identified potential areas for improving both user experience and engagement. 
The insights also suggest opportunities for new features that could help Bellabeat’s users optimize their health and well-being.
