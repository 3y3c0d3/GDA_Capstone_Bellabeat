Data Source: 30 participants FitBit Fitness Tracker Data from Mobius: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit

The dataset has 18 CSVs and follows a ROCCC outline:

**Reliability:** The data is from 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data and generated by from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk.  

**Original:** The data is from 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data via Amazon Mechanical Turk.  

**Comprehensive:** Data minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. While the data tracks many factors in the user activity and sleep, but the sample size is small and most data is recorded during certain days of the week.  

**Current:** Data is from March 2016 to May 2016. Data is not current so the users habit may be different now.  

**Cited:** Unknown.  

 #### The dataset has limitations: ####

Only 30 user data is available. The central limit theorem general rule of n≥30 applies and we can use the t test for statstic reference. However, a larger sample size is preferred for the analysis.
Upon further investigation with n_distinct() to check for unique user Id, the set has 33 user data from daily activity, 24 from sleep and only 8 from weight. There are 3 extra users and some users did not record their data for tracking daily activity and sleep.
For the 8 user data for weight, 5 users manually entered their weight and 3 recorded via a connected wifi device (eg: wifi scale).
Most data is recorded from Tuesday to Thursday, which may not be comprehensive enough to form an accurate analysis.
