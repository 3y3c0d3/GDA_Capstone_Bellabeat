-- 1) Quick health checks

-- 2) Clean views (distinct rows, correct types already)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `endless-ripple-465615-b4.Bellabeat.v_activity_clean` AS

-- Ensure uniqueness (one row per user per day)
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `endless-ripple-465615-b4.Bellabeat.daily_activity_sleep` AS

-- 4) Helper tables
-- Weekday trends
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `endless-ripple-465615-b4.Bellabeat.weekday_trends` AS

-- Step segments
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `endless-ripple-465615-b4.Bellabeat.user_step_segments` AS

  Id,

-- 5) QA
SELECT 'daily_activity_sleep' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM `endless-ripple-465615-b4.Bellabeat.daily_activity_sleep`;

SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN ActivityDate IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_date,
